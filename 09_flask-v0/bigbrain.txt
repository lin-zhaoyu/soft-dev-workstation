k09 -- First Thoughts on a Flask App
2021-10-04

Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
It seems a bit like a constructor in Java without the `new` keyword
Perhaps it is taking in the `__name__` constant and passing it to Flask in order to make a new object
Then returns it to be saved as the `app` variable


Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
I think it refers to the root or homepage of a website, as in there are no further specifications after the domain
i.e. just http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and nothing after the final "/"
"/" to me is the root directory of my system so it might make sense in the context of a webpage too

Q2: Where will this print to?
Directly to the terminal, since in Python, print statements go to the standard output
Not the console of the webpage like `console.log` might in javascript

Q3: What will it print?
Since app.py was run directly from the terminal rather than from another module, the `__name__` variable is set to "__main__"
Thus, it will print out "__main__" when printed

# Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
We don't think "No hablo queso" will be printed, since it is being returned instead of printed

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
`run()` could be similar to executing a function with `function()` as seen in java

Notes
- The app keeps running indefinitely as a "development" server
- The "No hablo queso" message actually does display directly on the webpage
- Terminal does display __main__ as predicted
    - Also shows HTTP GET requests when webpage is loaded

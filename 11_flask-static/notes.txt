k11 -- Static Flask App Experiments
2021-10-07

Predictionss
- The code in the `if` statement will run since we run app.py from the terminal, so __name__ is set to "__main__"
- Same as k10 v3 app.py, printing two messages to the terminal when the page is loaded
    - First will be: "about to print __name__..."
    - Then: "__main__" since the program is being called directly
- Serves a webpage on localhost port 5000
- Webpage will display "No hablo queso!" when on the "/" root page
- Debug mode will be listed as "on"
    - Maybe some extra information will be printed to the terminal
    - Update code onto the website by auto reloading

Notes
- Webpage acts as expected, continues to run indefinitely
- Debug mode is set on, and gives a debugging PIN
- Messages only appear on the terminal after the webpage is loaded
    - Redeploys page on changes to the file
- Warns on being a "development server" and not to actually use for production
- No HTML tags for the message, just a raw string "No hablo queso!"
- Terminal displays HTTP GET Requests every time the page is loaded
- Able to access two files in the "static" folder
    - The regular "foo" file is downloaded
    - The HTML version of "foo" is properly displayed as a page
    - Corresponding HTTP GET requests listed in the terminal
- If the "static" folder is renamed anything else, direct access is limitee=d

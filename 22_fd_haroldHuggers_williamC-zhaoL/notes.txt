-Lets you prototype sites
  -is good because prototypes can be simple
-stable
-designed for small devices and up
-high fedelity: means the protype is already highly functional and interactive



-CDN:
-some central server that hosts a thing, lots of mirrors(CDNS) that host the same thing
-make websites appear faster especially in mobile devices
-these CDNs mirror the central servers
-less traffic and congestion overall

downsides: people that clone your repo has to wait for the servers to load

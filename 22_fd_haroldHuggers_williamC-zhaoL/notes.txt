is a very useful site that tells you what can be done

-high fedelity: means the protype is already highly functional and interactive
***Cool Features
-embedded pictures --you can change the aspect ratios in foundation
-embedded videos

-CDN:
-some central server that hosts a thing, lots of mirrors(CDNS) that host the same thing
-make websites appear faster especially in mobile devices
-these CDNs mirror the central servers
-less traffic and congestion overall

downsides: people that clone your repo has to wait for the servers to load

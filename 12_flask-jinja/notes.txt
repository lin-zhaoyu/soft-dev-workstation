Predictionss
- importing the `render_template` function from flask module
    - If removed, program will crash because the medthod is called in the
"/my_foist_template" route
- Using an additional route titled "/my_foist_template", use http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template to access
- `render_template` method takes three arguments
    - First one is what file to look for in the /templates folder
    - Second two are linked to the variables used in the templates
    - Will replace the variables on the wesbpage with whatever is passed in the method and display accordingly
- The `for` loop will display each item in `collection` in order with a newline between each item

Notes
- Routes act as expected, serving a site at "/my_foist_template"
    - "model_tmplt.html" cannot be accessed directly, unlike if it was in the "static" folder
- Variable uses have double curly brackets
- Control flow statements (such as the for loop)use one curly bracket and a percent symbol
    - Also has an end statement, unlike Python
    - For loop uses same syntax as Python
